Description: 
"MotoViz: Mapping Motorcycle Crash Data," is centered around the analysis and visualization of motorcycle crash data to gain valuable insights into accident trends, patterns, and safety recommendations.
The primary data source for this project consists of records of motorcycle accidents, including details such as date and time of the accident, location, weather conditions, road type, rider behavior, and the severity of injuries sustained. 
Some questions to be explored would be what are the trends in accidents, are the accidents seasonal, what could prevent motorcycle accidents and improve safety, and how to use the data to gain useful insights.

Intellectual Merit: 
The intellectual merit of this project lies in its potential to produce new insights in the field of motorcycle safety and accident prevention. There are many points which can be covered and explored to gain useful insights such as - Geographical insights, Factors influencing injury severity, seasonal trends, effectiveness of safety measures and many more. 
By analyzing motorcycle crash data and visualizing it, this project will provide a foundation for evidence-based decision-making and offer valuable insights that can lead to advancements in motorcycle safety practices and policies. 

Data Sourcing: 
I believe this data is related to public safety and wellness, most of it can be scraped through various goverment wesbsites, transportation authorities, and national safety organizations that collect and oublis this data. More steps to data sourcing is checking data credibility, data availability, and following data privacy and ethics.
